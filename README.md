# sosecrets-rs

Aims to be a crate for Secrets Management in Rust.

# Minimum Supported Rust version

The crate currently requires Rust 1.70. I have no intent of increasing the
compiler version requirement of this crate beyond this. However, this is only
guaranteed within a given minor version number.
